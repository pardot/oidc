// Package core is an library implementation of helpers for implementing the
// core OIDC specification
// (https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html). It aims to provide
// the tools needed to build a compliant implementation of the specification.
// Note: It does not _enforce_ all behaviours required by the spec,
// implementations that consume this should be sure to not introduce
// non-compliant behaviours.
